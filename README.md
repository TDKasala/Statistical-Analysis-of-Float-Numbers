## Prerequisites

Before you run the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/float-number-statistics.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd float-number-statistics
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python float_number_statistics.py
   ```

## Usage

The script prompts the user to enter 10 different float numbers. It then performs various statistical calculations and displays the results.

## Statistical Measures

The script calculates and displays the following statistical measures:

- **Total**: The sum of all the input numbers.

- **Maximum**: The maximum number among the input numbers.

- **Minimum**: The minimum number among the input numbers.

- **Average**: The average (mean) of the input numbers, rounded to two decimal places.

- **Median**: The median of the input numbers. If the number of input values is even, it calculates the average of the two middle values; otherwise, it takes the middle value directly.
